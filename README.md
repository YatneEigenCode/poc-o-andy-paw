POC Using Generic BT Devices as Detectors, Monitored by Androids
4/28/2015 JChoy - Concept statement and research/coding started.
#
Detect circuit open/close event by using the detector circuit to power a blue tooth device.
Circuit open/close gadgets can be common cheap hardware like window magnets. 
The blue tooth device is paired ahead of time with the monitoring Android app/script. 
The app/script would detect such an event to trigger remote notification like email, SMS, webPost, imgDrop, etc.
This can be a low cost, scrap reuse project for a cheap burglar alarm.
